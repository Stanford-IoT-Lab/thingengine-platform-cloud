          | Gabby and Hemanth are both music enthusiasts.
          | They love music and want to control their music with voice through any device around them.
          | However, the Spotify skill on Alexa or Google Home does not do what they want such as
          | changing their playlist.
          | They built Almond Music together as a quarter-long class project with the goal
          | of creating the best music virtual assistant. We collaborate with them to integrate
          | the service with both Alexa and Google Home.
          | The integration layer is still under development. In the future, it will be fully automated
          | once a device is added to Thingpedia.

          | Sharing the smart speaker between multiple people in the household has been a pain
          | point for voice virtual assistant.
          | In this video, we demo how Almond can be used to identify users with their voice
          | and provide fine-grained access control based on the detected identity.
          | In our design, users are allowed to share any of their digital personal information
          | they have access to,
          | and control who, what, when, where, and how the data are to be shared.
          | The infrastructure of Almond also support remote access control,
          | where each user talks to their own Almond and Almonds communicate with each other to
          | manage the sharing and access control.
