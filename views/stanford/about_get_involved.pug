                  | Gabby and Hemanth are both music enthusiasts.
                  | They love music and want to control their music with voice through any device around them.
                  | However, the Spotify skill on Alexa or Google Home does not do what they want such as
                  | changing their playlist.
                  | They built Almond Music together as a quarter-long class project with the goal
                  | of creating the best music virtual assistant. We collaborate with them to integrate
                  | the service with both Alexa and Google Home.
                  | The integration layer is still under development. In the future, it will be fully automated
                  | once a device is added to Thingpedia.

                  | Sharing a smart speaker among multiple people in the household is useful
                  | but at the same time raises privacy and parental control issues.
                  | In this video, we demo how Almond can be used to identify users with their voice
                  | and provide fine-grained access control based on the detected identity.
                  | In our design, users are allowed to share any of their digital personal information
                  | they have access to,
                  | and control who, what, when, where, and how the data are to be shared.
                  | The infrastructure of Almond also supports remote access control,
                  | where each user talks to their own Almond and Almonds communicate with each other to
                  | manage the sharing and access control.
