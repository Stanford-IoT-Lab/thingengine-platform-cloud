# Cloud Almond Configuration Options Reference

## DATABASE_URL
Database URL.

This must be the URL of the MySQL server shared by all almond-cloud components.

The format is:
```
mysql://<user>:<password>@<hostname>/<db_name>?<options>
```
See the documentation of node-mysql for options.
If you use Amazon RDS, you should say so with `ssl=Amazon%20RDS`.
It is recommended you set `timezone=Z` in the options (telling the database to store dates and times in UTC timezone).

For legacy reasons, this defaults to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
Using environment variables is currently secure but deprecated (because it can lead to security bugs).

Note: do not set this in `custom_config.js`, only in `/etc/almond-cloud/config.js`.

Default value: `process.env.DATABASE_URL`

## SECRET_KEY
Secret key for cookie signing.

This can be an arbitrary secret string. It is recommended to choose 64 random HEX characters (256 bit security).
Choose a secure secret to prevent session hijacking.

For legacy reasons, this defaults to the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
Using environment variables is currently secure but deprecated (because it can lead to security bugs).
The server will refuse to start if this option is not set.

Default value: `process.env.SECRET_KEY`

## JWT_SIGNING_KEY
Secret key for JsonWebToken signing (OAuth 2.0 tokens)

This can be an arbitrary secret string. It is recommended to choose 64 random HEX characters (256 bit security).
Choose a secure secret to prevent forging OAuth access tokens.

For legacy reasons, this defaults to the `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` environment variable.
Using environment variables is currently secure but deprecated (because it can lead to security bugs).
The server will refuse to start if this option is not set.

Default value: `process.env.JWT_SIGNING_KEY`

## AES_SECRET_KEY
Symmetric encryption key for user authentication material

This key is used whenever user-authentication-related secret material must be encrypted symmetrically,
rather than simply hashed. In particular, it is used to encrypt and decrypt per-user 2-factor keys.

This secret must be exactly 32 hex characters (128 bits).

For legacy reasons, this defaults to the `AES_SECRET_KEY` environment variable.
Using environment variables is currently secure but deprecated (because it can lead to security bugs).
The server will refuse to start if this option is not set.

Default value: `process.env.AES_SECRET_KEY`

## THINGENGINE_MANAGER_ADDRESS
Address of each master process.

Each address must be specified in sockaddr form:
- absolute or relative path for Unix socket
- hostname:port for TCP

Multiple addresses can be provided, in which case the users will be sharded across
multiple masters based on their ID (using a simple hashing scheme).

The number of shards can be changed dynamically, provided all processes use
a consistent configuration (they must be all stopped when the configuration is changed),
and all shards have access to shared storage (e.g. NFS).
If the storage is not shared, use the `get-user-shards` to compute which user is
assigned to which shard, and transfer the user's folder appropriately.

Default value: `['./control']`

## THINGENGINE_MANAGER_AUTHENTICATION
Access token to communicate with the master process.

This **must** be set if communication happens over to TCP, but can be left to
the default `null` value if communication happens over Unix domain sockets, in which
case file system permissions are used to restrict access.

Default value: `null`

## WITH_THINGPEDIA
Thingpedia configuration.

Set this option to 'embedded' to enable the embedded Thingpedia,
to 'external' to use the Thingpedia at THINGPEDIA_URL.

Default value: `'external'`

## THINGPEDIA_URL
Thingpedia URL

This is used by the Almond backend to communicate with the external Thingpedia,
and it is also used to construct links to Thingpedia from My Almond.
It **must** be set to `'/thingpedia'` to use the embedded Thingpedia.

Default value: `'https://thingpedia.stanford.edu/thingpedia'`

## FILE_STORAGE_DIR
Where to store icons and zip files.

This can be a relative or absolute path, or a file: or s3: URI.
The location must be writable by the frontend Almond processes.
Relative paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, or
the `THINGENGINE_ROOTDIR` environment variable if set.

NOTE: correct operation requires file: URIs to use the local hostname, that is, they should
be of the form `file:///`, with 3 consecutive slashes.

Default value: `'./shared/download'`

## CACHE_DIR
Where to cache entity icons and contact avatars.

This can be a relative or absolute path.
The location must be writable by the frontend Almond processes.
Relative paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, or
the `THINGENGINE_ROOTDIR` environment variable if set.

Note: unlike other _DIR configuration keys, this key cannot be a URL. The cache directory
is always on the local machine where the Almond process runs.

Default value: `'./shared/cache'`

## CDN_HOST
The location where icons and zip files can be retrieved.

If using S3 storage, this could be the S3 website URL, or the URL
of a CloudFront distribution mapping to the S3 bucket.
If using local storage, or if no CDN is available, it must be the
exact string `"/download"`.

Default value: `'/download'`

## ASSET_CDN
The CDN to use for website assets (javascript, css, images files contained in public/ )

You should configure your CDN to map the URL you specify here to the /assets
path on the frontend server (SERVER_ORIGIN setting).

Use a fully qualified URL (including https://) and omit the trailing slash.
Use the default `/assets` if you do not want to use a CDN, in which case assets will
be loaded directly from your configured frontend server.

Default value: `'/assets'`

## USE_BRAND
Which branding to use for the website.

Valid values are "generic" (no branding) or "stanford" (Stanford University logo and
footer). Note that the Stanford University logo is a registered trademark, and therefore
using "stanford" branding requires permission.

Default value: `'generic'`

## SERVER_ORIGIN
The origin (scheme, hostname, port) where the server is reachable.

This is used for redirects and CORS checks.

Default value: `'http://127.0.0.1:8080'`

## ENABLE_REDIRECT
Enable redirection to SERVER_ORIGIN for requests with different hostname
or scheme.

Use this to enable transparent HTTP to HTTPS redirection.

Default value: `true`

## ENABLE_SECURITY_HEADERS
Enable HTTPs security headers.

Enable Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy and other
headers. This option has no effect if the server is not available over TLS.

Default value: `false`

## ABOUT_OVERRIDE
Override which pug file to use for about pages.

Use this option to customize the index, terms-of-service, etc. pages
The key should be the page name (part of path after /about),
the value should be the name of a pug file in views, without the .pug
extension.

If unspecified, defaults to "about_" + page_name, eg. for `privacy`
it defaults to showing `about_privacy.pug`.

If you plan to serve Web Almond to users and allow registration,
at the minimum you must override the `tos` page (terms of service) and the
`privacy` page (privacy policy), as they are empty in the default installation.

Use ABOUT_OVERRIDE['index'] to override the whole website index.
Note that "/about" with no page unconditionally redirects to "/",

Default value: `{}`

## EXTRA_ABOUT_PAGES
Adds new pages to the /about hierarchy

This option is an array of objects. The format should be:
```
{
  url: path name, excluding /about part
  title: page title
  view: name of pug file
}
```

Default value: `[]`

## EXTRA_NAVBAR
Adds new links to the navbar

This option is an array of objects. The format should be:
```
{
  url: link URL
  title: link title
}
```

Default value: `[]`

## EXTRA_ORIGINS
Additional origins that should be allowed to make Cookie-authenticated
API requests.

Note: this is a very unsafe option, and can easily lead to credential
leaks. Use this at your own risk.

Default value: `[]`

## OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGIN
The base URL used for OAuth redirects

This is used by the OAuth configuration mechanism for accounts/devices
in Web Almond. It is used by Login With Google. The full OAuth redirect
URI for Google is OAUTH_REDIRECT_ORIGIN + `/user/oauth2/google/callback`

By default, it is the same as SERVER_ORIGIN, but you can change it
if you put a different value in the developer console / redirect URI
fields of the various services.

Default value: `module.exports.SERVER_ORIGIN`

## ENABLE_ANONYMOUS_USER
Enable anonymous user.

Set this option to true to let users try out Almond without logging in.
They will operate as the user "anonymous".

Default value: `false`

## ENABLE_DEVELOPER_PROGRAM
Enable developer program.

Set this option to allow users to become Almond developers, and create
OAuth apps that access the Web Almond APIs, as well as new Thingpedia
devices or LUInet models.

Default value: `false`

## WITH_LUINET

This must be set to the full URL both if you use the public NL inference
server, and if you use the embedded server.

Default value: `'https://almond-nl.stanford.edu'`

## NL_SERVER_ADMIN_TOKEN

Set this key to your Thingpedia developer key if you're configuring a custom
NLP server but you want to use the public Thingpedia.

Default value: `null`

## NL_TOKENIZER_ADDRESS
The address (socket path or host:port) of a running Almond Tokenizer.

This is only used if WITH_LUINET === 'embedded'. If the environment
variable `THINGENGINE_USE_TOKENIZER` is set, it is used by both the
frontend and the NLP processes; otherwise, only by the NLP process.

Default value: `'127.0.0.1:8888'`

## NL_MODEL_DIR
Deployed model directory.

This is the path containing the models that should be served by the NLP inference
server. It can be a relative or absolute path, or a file: or s3: URI.
Relative paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, or
the `THINGENGINE_ROOTDIR` environment variable if set.

For a file URI, if the training and inference servers are on different machines,
you should specify the hostname of the inference server. The training server will
use `rsync` to upload the model after training.

If this is set to `null`, trained models will not be uploaded to a NLP inference
server. This is not a valid setting for the inference server.

Default value: `'./models'`

## NL_SERVICE_NAME

Default value: `24000`

## TRAINING_DIR
The directory to use to store training jobs (datasets, working directories and trained models).

This can be a relative or absolute path, or a file: or s3: URI.
Relative paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory, or
the `THINGENGINE_ROOTDIR` environment variable if set.

NOTE: correct operation requires file: URIs to use the local hostname, that is, they should
be of the form `file:///`, with 3 consecutive slashes.

Default value: `'./training'`

## TRAINING_TASK_BACKEND
Which backend to use to run compute-intensive training tasks.

Valid options are `local`, which spawns a local process, and `kubernetes`, which creates
