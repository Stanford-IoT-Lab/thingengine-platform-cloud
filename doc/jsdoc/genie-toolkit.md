This is the documentation for the [genie-toolkit](https://npmjs.com/genie-toolkit) library,
which is the core conversational technology of the Almond virtual assistant.
It includes the device configuration part, the parts of the ThingTalk runtime that interface with Thingpedia,
the conversational agent, natural language processing tools, and internationalization code.

This library is only useful for integrators who are deploying Almond on a new platform, and
developers of Almond itself. Anyone else will most likely use Genie from the command line,
and should refer to its documentation instead.
